# Shear Stress vs Normal Stress Plot

This repository contains a Python script that visualizes the relationship between shear stress and normal stress using the Mohr-Coulomb failure envelope. The script employs the Matplotlib library for plotting and Numpy for numerical operations.

## Features

- Plots the Mohr-Coulomb failure envelope based on user-defined parameters for cohesion and friction angle.
- Visualizes a specific stress point on the graph, highlighting its position in relation to the failure envelope.
- Includes axis labeling, title, grid, and legends for clarity and better understanding.

## Requirements

To run the script, you need to have Python installed along with the following packages:

- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
